# Frameworks & Libraries

Abstracted libraries that will be used accross multiple projects.

Important: These libraries live in their own repository instead of living in the pripelines/projects repository. It's a choice that has pros and cons. I made this choice because Amine mentioned that in Servier, they wanted to switch from a mono repo to a multi repos.
